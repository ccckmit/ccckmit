Visual selection is a common feature in applications, but Vim's visual selection has several benefits.
To cut-and-paste or copy-and-paste:

Position the cursor at the beginning of the text you want to cut/copy.
Press v to begin character-based visual selection, or V to select whole lines, or Ctrl-v or Ctrl-q to select a block.
Move the cursor to the end of the text to be cut/copied. While selecting text, you can perform searches and other advanced movement.
Press d (delete) to cut, or y (yank) to copy.
Move the cursor to the desired paste location.
Press p to paste after the cursor, or P to paste before.
Visual selection (steps 1-3) can be performed using a mouse.
