## 安裝 tensorflow

Installing with native pip

If the following version of Python is not installed on your machine, install it now:

Python 3.5.x from python.org
TensorFlow only supports version 3.5.x of Python on Windows. Note that Python 3.5.x comes with the pip3 package manager, which is the program you'll use to install TensorFlow.

To install TensorFlow, start a terminal. Then issue the appropriate pip3 install command in that terminal. To install the CPU-only version of TensorFlow, enter the following command:

> C:\> pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow

To install the GPU version of TensorFlow, enter the following command:

> C:\> pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu
